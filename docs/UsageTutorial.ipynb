    "Other option is to use the MNIST dataset. To do this you need to be aware of a very important aspect of the nature of the quantum algorithms: **you can operate with a very limited number of qubits**. This means that, if you wish to classify an actual image, you need to preprocess it before applying the algorithms in order to reduce its dimensionality and be able to use the data (we recommend this to data with a dimension greater than 32). To do this to the MNIST dataset you can use one of the three options we give you:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use PCA (PCA).** You can use PCA method to achieve a dimension reduction. The only problem this method has is that you have to assume a linear relationship between the input and the output, so, if there is a non-linear relationship, you can generate non-accurate data.\n",
    "2. **Use simple autoencoder (AE).** You can use a simple autoencoder in order to achieve a dimension reduction. This solves the non-linear cases, but increases the execution time, because you have to train a neural network.\n",
    "3. **Use autoencoder based on CNN (AE_CNN).** With this less simple implementation of the autoencoder you will achieve much more accuracy than with the simple autoencoder by trading time of execution and complexity.\n",
