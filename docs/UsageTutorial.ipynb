To do this you need to be aware of a very important aspect of the nature of the quantum algorithms: **you can operate with a very limited number of qubits**. This means that, if you wish to classify an actual image, you need to preprocess it before applying the algorithms in order to reduce its dimensionality and be able to use the data (we recommend this to data with a dimension greater than 32). To do this you can use one of the three options we give you:\n",
